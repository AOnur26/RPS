A very basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game that i coded with the stuff that i learned in the first weeks of my c# learning progress. I needed to research and learn how to clear the console, so i can apply it for avioding the 2nd player to see the answer of the 1st player. Also after the 2nd player enter their answer it was instantly giving the winner of the game. In the 2 friends playing scenario, it seemed like there is no suspense getting the winner message before the 1st player opens their eyes so i needed to delay the winner message for giving enough time to the 1st player to open their eyes and wait for the winner message. Because of this, i learned how to add a countdown to my code and applied it. First i set the timer to 5 seconds but when i tryed it with some of my friend i realized its way too long. In the end i decided to reduce it to 3 seconds and it felt just alright.
